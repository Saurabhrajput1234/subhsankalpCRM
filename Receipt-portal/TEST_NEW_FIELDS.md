# Testing New Receipt Fields

## New Fields Added:
1. **PanAadhar** - String field for PAN or Aadhar number
2. **CompanyName** - Dropdown with options: "Subhsankalp", "Golden City"
3. **ReceiptType** - Dropdown with options: "token", "booking"

## Database Changes:
- ✅ Migration created and applied successfully
- ✅ New columns added to Receipts table

## Backend Changes:
- ✅ Receipt model updated
- ✅ DTOs updated (CreateReceiptDto, ReceiptResponseDto)
- ✅ Controller updated to handle new fields
- ✅ Admin auto-approval logic implemented

## Frontend Changes:
- ✅ CreateReceiptForm updated with new fields
- ✅ Receipt template updated to display new fields
- ✅ Receipt details modal updated
- ✅ Form validation and default values set

## Testing Steps:
1. Create a new receipt with the new fields
2. Verify fields are saved to database
3. Verify fields display in receipt template
4. Verify admin-created receipts are auto-approved
5. Test both token and booking receipt types

## Expected Behavior:
- **Associate creates receipt**: Status = "Pending" (needs approval)
- **Admin creates receipt**: Status = "Approved" (auto-approved)
- **Receipt Type**: Affects plot status (token → Tokened, booking → Booked/Sold)
- **Company Name**: Shows in receipt template
- **PAN/Aadhar**: Shows in receipt template and details
